# First-C-Project- PGM FILES
_Learn C programming language in 2 algorithm class lesson then done my first project_
Because of the Covid-19, my school switches from semester to quarter schedule. Therefore, instead of learning class CS310: Algorithms (computer science upper level class) in 14 weeks, we only learn it in 7 weeks. 

Starting my Fall 2 quarter semester in October, I have 2 class lessons in the first week to get used to new programming language - C. From a (only) Python background student, I find it's such a challenge to understand and apply C in a short time. However, I have the first class project using C to work with multidimensional arrays and file input/output.

We have 2 parts in this project:
+ Part 1:
Write a program image.c to read an image of PGM P2 format, and produce its
negative image and its 90-degree clockwise rotation.
+ Part 2: 
Given 9 pgm images, all showing a nice sculpture but also a curious
visitor who happened to be around when the images were taken. Write a program
that can “filter” out the visitor and produce a nice clean image of the structure and
background only, without the person. Use an image processing technique that finds the median value of the pixel across similar images to remove the noise and reveal the “average” image.

Most of sculpture is visible in each of the 9 images and the person only blocked part of the sculpture. Since he is in a different position in each photo, he blocks a different part of the sculpture each time. My job is to determine which pixel grey levels are part of the
sculpture and the background (what you want), and which pixel colors are part of the person (what you don't want). Then you could create a photo without the person.
